			An engineering student leads a busy life. Being one myself I can say that with authority. Currently I am a third year student of NED University
			, Computer and information Systems department.
			<br/>My studies introduced me to the world of computers. It made me a programming addict and a hardware enthusiast. But, most of all my studies
			made me a crazy lunatic. One has to expect that from an engineering student, in the end we all reach the limit of our mental stability.
